# The-Executioner-1.1
‘The Executioner’ is a simple game software which is designed to give the user an opportunity to guess the given word by using

Java and Android studio. The first step includes posing the question to the user in the form of pictures or words. For ex: if the

user has to guess the name of the city, a picture of the city will be shown to the user and if the user gets it right in the first

attempt, he wins. Else the user may ask for a clue, where the software provides a stipulated clue but deducts one lifeline of his.

Similarly the user will be given some amount of lifelines which are limited. When the limitation is exceeded the user loses and

may begin a new game again. It is a very simple game designed to give an intriguing experience to the user while guessing a

simple word, where clues are provided to ease the difficult of guessing a word.
